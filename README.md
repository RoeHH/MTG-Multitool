# MTG Multitool
## What is the MTG Multitool
I developed the "MTG Multitool" as a result of a school project. For the Raspbery Pi with a 480x320px toutch display.
It includes a function that displays tokens as images, a life counter for the lives of both players and a coin toss. 
It is my first project I developed with HTML,CSS and JavaScript. Therefore I ask for feedback and suggestions for improvements of my coding style.
With the release of a new edition or on demand I will gladly create a new page with tokens. But only as long as I do not get too many requests.
## Coming Soon:
Soon I will upload a scaling version of the "MTG Multitool" to my website. Which is optimized for telephones. Link will follow as soon as it is done.
## I need you!
If you have an idea for an improvement or a new function, tell me about it or develope it yourself. Especially if you can give me tips and tricks for my coding.
